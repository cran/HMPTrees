CHANGES IN HMPTrees VERSION 1.5

CHANGES

* Changed the getMLEandLoglike function to return additional values and use weightCols instead of weight

* Tidied up some code, comments and variable names

* Rewrote how trees are created

* Changed mergeDataSets to not calculate MLEs by default

* Changed generateTrees arguments to allow for different number of reads per sample

* transformHMPTreetoHMP and transformHMPtoHMPTree are now internal functions since they don't really do much more than transposing data frames

* Stopped using 'samples' in several functions to select which trees to use.  Just pass in only the trees to use.

* Simplified plotTreeDataMDS's arguments some
